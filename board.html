          C-suite executive. He started his ventures as a partner with Woods
          Gordon (now Ernst & Young). In 1984 he joined National Sea, Canada's
          then-largest seafood company, as COO. He quickly earned the title of
          CEO and served until 1989. Becoming CEO of United Cooperatives of
          Ontario was his next accomplishment, and he later went on to become
          Alberta Wheat Pool's CEO.
          This allowed him to solidify his company's reputations by leading them
          through crucial phases of corporate evolution. Cummings' leadership
          paved the way for Alberta Wheat Pool to merge with other companies
          and finally become Argicore United. He chose to step down in 2002 but
          remained active as Chief Executive at the Canadian Executive Service
          Organization (CESO) until 2005. He's served on over 20 boards,
          including chairman positions at Pacific Aqua Foods Limited, UCO
          Petroleum Inc., and the Western Grain Elevator Association.
          He graduated from Concordia University (formerly Sir George Williams)
          in 1964 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. While still working fulltime,
          he earned his MBA from McMaster University in 1988. Gordon has
          lectured at the University of Toronto and McGill University, served as
          chairman of numerous committees for the Society of Management
          Accountants of Canada, and volunteers for a variety of organizations,
          including St. Clement Church. <br></p>

            He collaborates with individuals and organizations, transforming them
            into reputable brands. This is done through extensive brand building and
            effective social media marketing. Dean has now built his social media
            business into a profitable enterprise.
            Dean stems from a family of entrepreneurs, owning everything from
            hotels to apartment buildings, RV dealerships, and jewellery stores. This
            has lead him to invest in real estate, now having multiple sizable
            investments, himself. His family is the motivation Dean needed to discard
            the thought of attending dental school and instead embrace his calling as a
            company advisor. After completing a BSc in chemistry, he formed his first
            media business.
            Dean’s interest in the senior housing market originates from his own
            experiences taking care of family members and seeing the difference that
            quality care can make. He strongly believes in providing innovative, highquality
            care and activities for people as they grow older. In the last 10
            years, Dean has been travelling the world to study the role of behavioural
            psychology and personal development in business finance.
            He has also gone on to attend conferences and seminars across the world,
            including Australia, Canada, England, U.S., and Scotland. <br></p>

            within distribution and retail of auto parts, manufacturing, steel fabrication,
            equipment (trucks, trailers, landscaping, construction, and snowplows), etc. He
            also has commercial leasing, real estate, and mortgage financing under his belt.
            With over nine years of M&A experience, managing strategic acquisitions from
            procurement through due diligence to the coordination of internal approval and
            communication processes for transaction completion, James has kept himself
            busy. His day-to-day execution of various M&A processes (sell-side, buy-side,
            structured transactions, and asset and share deals) is also something he prides
            himself on.
            James has thorough knowledge of corporate finance and accounting, with an
            excellent understanding of the legal and tax aspects related to M&A transactions.
            He's acquired 14 private companies and led 15 industrial property transactions.
            Furthermore, James has had the opportunity to start up eleven companies, some
            with joint venture partners.
            As a highly collaborative leader, team builder, and change manager, James has
            added to his knowledge by screening and analyzing potential opportunities for
            strategic fit. He's considered an optimistic and pragmatic problem solver with
            proficiency in leading large and cross-functional teams in a project management
            environment.<br></p>

          <p class="text-left pb-5 text-black">Originally having settled in Scotland, where she worked as an RN for a large
            psychiatric hospital, Susie Macmaster moved to Canada in 2001. She has over 18
            years of experience in the senior housing industry. With a solid understanding of
            market analysis, sales, and quality assurance, Susier has the ability to problem
            solve in a fast paced environment and possesses strong directorship, mentorship,
            and leadership skills with a commitment to exceptional customer service and
            personal excellence.
            In 2003, Susie joined the Hallman group of retirement homes as a health and
            wellness manager driven by her passion for dementia and palliative care. After
            being acquired by Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT in 2008, Susie was offered
            the position of Regional Director, Sales and Marketing. She was responsible for
            overseeing the sales and marketing initiatives for Chartwell's south-western
            portfolio. The operational aspect of the senior housing industry was very
            interesting to Susie. In 2010, she accepted the position of general manager at
            Seasons Bell Lane in Brantford. After two years, Susie was offered the
            opportunity to return to Chartwell as the Regional Director of Operations for
            Chartwell’s new-build portfolio.
            Susie then returned to Season Retirement Communities as the Senior Director of
            Care Services in 2015. During this time, she played a key role in the acquisition
            of eight retirement communities in Alberta, which doubled the Seasons
            Retirement Community portfolio.<br></p>
