His grandfather and uncle owned hotels and motels meaning Dean has been around the hospitality and accommodation industry since childhood. He knows what it looks like to operate in that industry with high quality management, housekeeping, and facilities. The assisted living industry has the same operational components and requirements for exceptional and reliable staffing and facilities.</p>

            <p class="text-left pb-5 text-black">Gordon Cummings is a retired CEO with over 20 years of experience as a
            C-suite executive. He started his ventures as a partner with Woods
            Gordon (now Ernst & Young). In 1984 he joined National Sea, Canada's
            then-largest seafood company, as COO. He quickly earned the title of
            CEO and served until 1989. Becoming CEO of United Cooperatives of
            Ontario was his next accomplishment, and he later went on to become
            Alberta Wheat Pool's CEO.
            This allowed him to solidify his company's reputations by leading them
            through crucial phases of corporate evolution. Cummings' leadership
            paved the way for Alberta Wheat Pool to merge with other companies
            and finally become Argicore United. He chose to step down in 2002 but
            remained active as Chief Executive at the Canadian Executive Service
            Organization (CESO) until 2005. He's served on over 20 boards,
            including chairman positions at Pacific Aqua Foods Limited, UCO
            Petroleum Inc., and the Western Grain Elevator Association.
            He graduated from Concordia University (formerly Sir George Williams)
            in 1964 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. While still working fulltime,
            he earned his MBA from McMaster University in 1988. Gordon has
            lectured at the University of Toronto and McGill University, served as
            chairman of numerous committees for the Society of Management
            Accountants of Canada, and volunteers for a variety of organizations,
            including St. Clement Church. <br></p>

            <p class="text-left pb-5 text-black">Dean Palibroda is a strong force in today’s social media marketing world.
              He collaborates with individuals and organizations, transforming them
              into reputable brands. This is done through extensive brand building and
              effective social media marketing. Dean has now built his social media
              business into a profitable enterprise.
              Dean stems from a family of entrepreneurs, owning everything from
              hotels to apartment buildings, RV dealerships, and jewellery stores. This
              has lead him to invest in real estate, now having multiple sizable
              investments, himself. His family is the motivation Dean needed to discard
              the thought of attending dental school and instead embrace his calling as a
              company advisor. After completing a BSc in chemistry, he formed his first
              media business.
              Dean’s interest in the senior housing market originates from his own
              experiences taking care of family members and seeing the difference that
              quality care can make. He strongly believes in providing innovative, highquality
              care and activities for people as they grow older. In the last 10
              years, Dean has been travelling the world to study the role of behavioural
              psychology and personal development in business finance.
              He has also gone on to attend conferences and seminars across the world,
              including Australia, Canada, England, U.S., and Scotland. <br></p>

            <p class="text-left pb-5 text-black">Originally having settled in Scotland, where she worked as an RN for a large
              psychiatric hospital, Susie Macmaster moved to Canada in 2001. She has over 18
              years of experience in the senior housing industry. With a solid understanding of
              market analysis, sales, and quality assurance, Susier has the ability to problem
              solve in a fast paced environment and possesses strong directorship, mentorship,
              and leadership skills with a commitment to exceptional customer service and
              personal excellence.
              In 2003, Susie joined the Hallman group of retirement homes as a health and
              wellness manager driven by her passion for dementia and palliative care. After
              being acquired by Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT in 2008, Susie was offered
              the position of Regional Director, Sales and Marketing. She was responsible for
              overseeing the sales and marketing initiatives for Chartwell's south-western
              portfolio. The operational aspect of the senior housing industry was very
              interesting to Susie. In 2010, she accepted the position of general manager at
              Seasons Bell Lane in Brantford. After two years, Susie was offered the
              opportunity to return to Chartwell as the Regional Director of Operations for
              Chartwell’s new-build portfolio.
              Susie then returned to Season Retirement Communities as the Senior Director of
              Care Services in 2015. During this time, she played a key role in the acquisition
              of eight retirement communities in Alberta, which doubled the Seasons
              Retirement Community portfolio.<br></p>

          <p class="text-black text-center m-auto w-full max-w-[75%]">There are 771 million people in the world who live without clean water. That's almost 1 in 10 people worldwide, or twice the population of the United States. Most of these people live in rural areas and spend hours every day walking to collect water for their family. Not only does walking for water keep children out of school or take up time that parents could be using to earn money, but more often than not the water carries disease that can make everyone sick. Access to clean water means education, income, and health especially for women and kids.</p>
